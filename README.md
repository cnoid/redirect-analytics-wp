# redirect-analytics-wp
Plugin that creates redirect links for WordPress, to capture analytics.
Simple version for those who have for example a fresh website used only for analytics. A simple `<html>...<body>Redirecting in 2 seconds..<somescripts></body>` type layout.
Themed version is more for everyone, it should display your current theme in WordPress - but just like anything WordPress this isn't promised (meaning, modifications might be relevant).
